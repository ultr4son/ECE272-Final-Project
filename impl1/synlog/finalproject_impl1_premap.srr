@W: MT529 :"c:\users\tristan thompson\documents\section4code\clock_counter.sv":14:2:14:10|Found inferred clock tennis|clk_inferred_clock which controls 45 sequential elements including counter_1.count[18:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
